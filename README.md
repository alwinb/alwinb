Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Alwin,

Welcome to my GitHub page! This is a place where I collect some of my work and some research projects. 

I often try to develop theory and application simultaneously.

A selection of projects, listed below.

### URL Specification

I am working on a number of projects around the specification of URLs.

- [URL Specification][url-spec] â€” An URL specification that generalises the WHATWG standard.
- [spec-url] â€” An implementation of the URL specification above.
- [reurl] â€” An URL manipulation library that supports relative URLs.

[spec-url]: https://github.com/alwinb/spec-url
[reurl]: https://github.com/alwinb/reurl

### HTML Language

I am working on some projects around the HTML language as well. The end goal is to create an accurate and concise characterisation of the HTML5 language as parsed, together with an implementation!

- [html-lexer] â€” An html lexer that produces annotated chunks of raw input.
- [tiny-html-lexer] â€” A very concise html lexer and tokeniser.
- [html-parser] â€” A declarative tree construction algorithm for HTML5. **WIP**.

### Graphics File Formats

Some fun projects.

- [Haikon-js] â€” A parser for HVIF vector icon files, in JS.
- [XoDB][xodb] â€” Some support for the reMarkable tablet database and â€“notebooks in JS.

### Logic things

- [Regex][ab-regex] â€” A close-to-theory regular expression compiler, using derivatives.
- [Ess][ess] â€” A research-y datastructure for semi-structuredâ€“data types.

### Web UI

- [Domex][domex] â€” A research-y alternative for template languages, based on 'DOM algebra'.

### Other

- [immutable-aatree] â€” A persistent ordered dictionary datastructure.
- [tiny-css-parser] â€” A CSS parser with a small code-base.
- [tm-plist] â€” A parser for the ASCII property list file format (as used by TextMate).
